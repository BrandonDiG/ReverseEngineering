 Learning Reverse Engineering
Read Me: 

This Repo is meant to show how the same/similar programs in different programming languages might be shown differently when decompiling/debugging. This is meant to step through easy steps of learning reversing simple to complex functionality of programs and identify differences when dealing with different languages. I have split the programs into different levels, with Level 1 being the simplest programs and higher levels being more complex. I will try to write the same program in multiple languages and include a write up of my reversing findings within each folder. Feel free to follow along and learn something!
